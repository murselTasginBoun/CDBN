Description

LFR networks are computer generated networks, given some parameters.
We used LFR networks of 1000 nodes and 5000 nodes.

We attached 10 sample networks with each mixing parameter for LFR networks consisting of 1000 nodes. 
These generated networks also have their 'ground-truth' (planted) community structure files.
Network files and community files match according to the suffix of filenames,
i.e.,
LFR_1000_15_50_C10_50_mix_0_1_1_1.net  has its community structure in file community_1_1.dat

Naming convention for LFR network file is:
LFR_(node_count)_(avg_degree)_(max_degree)_(min_community_size)_(max_community_Size)_(mixingParamter)_(Filesequence).net
